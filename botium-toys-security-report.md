## Recommendations

To strengthen Botium Toys’ overall security posture and reduce risks to its assets, it is essential to implement stronger access control measures. This includes enforcing the principles of least privilege and separation of duties, ensuring that employees can access only the data and systems necessary for their roles. A centralized password management system should also be adopted to enforce stricter password policies, support automated resets, and reduce the burden on IT support. In parallel, encryption protocols must be implemented for all stored and transmitted credit card and sensitive customer data to meet PCI DSS standards and enhance data confidentiality.

Equally important is the need to establish and regularly test a formal disaster recovery and business continuity plan. This should include scheduled backups of critical data to mitigate data loss risks in case of system failures or security incidents. Botium Toys should also install an intrusion detection system (IDS) to monitor for malicious activity in real time, providing an additional layer of protection against cyber threats. Furthermore, a thorough classification and inventory of all data assets should be conducted to align with GDPR and SOC requirements, enabling better governance and prioritization of data protection efforts.

Lastly, enhancing company-wide compliance training is crucial. All employees—not just those in IT—should receive regular education on data privacy, security policies, and compliance obligations. Enforcing privacy procedures and policies across departments will promote a culture of security awareness and ensure consistent adherence to regulatory standards. These actions, if taken promptly, will significantly reduce the company's exposure to fines, data breaches, and reputational damage.
